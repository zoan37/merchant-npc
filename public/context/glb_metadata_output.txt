        A stylized, steampunk-inspired pistol is depicted from four different angles.  It's a golden-brown color,
        intricately decorated with detailed, ornate engravings and what appear to be metallic gears, rivets, and
        embellishments.  Large, translucent, light-green crystals are prominent features, particularly the one jutting
        out from the barrel of the pistol, giving off a futuristic and otherworldly aesthetic.  Internal glowing green
        lights add to the design's sci-fi feel.
